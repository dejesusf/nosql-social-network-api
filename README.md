# NoSQL Social Network API

## Description

By using Mongoose and MongoDB, I was tasked to create a Social Network API where a user can be created, updated, and deleted and their thoughts can also be created, updated, and deleted. There are also added features where friends can be added to the user's friends list and reactions can be made under a thought post. This application is not deployed as it is an API, so if you would like to see how to use this, please watch the video linked [HERE](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zcRyfLdGaHjPX-noXzpxzN5oCCV_H3Kq/view?usp=sharing).

Unfortunatly, there is an issue with the reaction route and it deletes all associated reactions instead of just the single reaction indicated by its id.
