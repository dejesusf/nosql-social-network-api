# NoSQL Social Network API

## Description

With the use of the npm package, Express, wer're able to create an application that the user may use to save and delete notes. Learning to use express was pretty complex. There were parts that took a while to understand but overall, I was glad to make this application work! Luckily, Express uses a similar forumla and syntax for the routing which over time, got easier to use.
